# Mobile-menu

> In this project I created the mobile menu for Portfolio using JavaScript. I added the following features:

   - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button, the mobile menu appears.
   - When the user clicks (or taps) the close (X) button, the mobile menu disappears.
   - When the user clicks (or taps) any of the mobile menu options, a correct part of the page is displayed.
